### __I courage you NOT to use this mod on servers that don't allow it. It may cause anti-cheat warnings and eventually you could end up getting banned.__

This simple mod allows you to place blocks in the air next to adjacent blocks, just like in Bedrock Minecraft.
It makes building process a lot easier, especially for people who play on mobile java minecraft emulators.
