### __I courage you NOT to use this mod on servers that don't allow it. It may cause anti-cheat warnings and eventually you could end up getting banned.__

This simple mod allows you to place blocks in the air next to adjacent blocks, just like in Bedrock Minecraft.
It makes building process a lot easier, especially for people who play on mobile java minecraft emulators.

## Requirements

- [Cloth Config API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config)

## Features
- __Horizontal placement__ - Allows you to place blocks on horizontal surface
- __Vertical placement__ - Allows you to place blocks on vertical surface
